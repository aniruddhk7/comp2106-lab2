        Zain Javadd Malik (/ˈmælɪk/; born 12 January 1993), better known as Zayn Malik, is an English singer and
        songwriter. Born and raised in Bradford, West Yorkshire, Malik auditioned as a solo contestant for the British
        music competition The X Factor in 2010. After being eliminated as a solo performer, Malik was brought back into
        the competition, along with four other contestants, to form the boy band that would later be known as One
        Direction. Malik left the group in March 2015 and subsequently signed a solo recording contract with RCA
        Records.

        Adopting a more alternative R&B music style with his debut studio album Mind of Mine (2016) and its lead single,
        "Pillowtalk", Malik became the first British male artist to debut at number one in both the UK and US, with his
        debut single and debut album. Malik is the recipient of several accolades, including an American Music Award,
        Billboard Music Award and MTV Video Music Award. In December 2018, he released his second studio album, Icarus
        Falls.
